# Leonardo da Vinci Portfolio Project

Project for the class Multidevice Apps of the Web Apps Development grade (DAW).

It is a visual, non-functional website design of what would be Leonardo da Vinci's artist web portfolio.

The main purpose of this project was to utilize and implement effectively SASS (scss) and some Bootstrap components, justifying their usage.

All images included where generated by me using AI, as well as the website's logo.

Made it in around one an a half entire days.
